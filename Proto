Why Protocol Buffers ?
Ans - Protocol buffers provide a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data in a forward-compatible and backward-compatible way.
Itâ€™s like JSON, except it's smaller and faster, and it generates native language bindings. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily
write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. Protocol buffers are a combination of the definition language (created in .proto files), the code that the proto compiler
generates to interface with data, language-specific runtime libraries, the serialization format for data that is written to a file (or sent across a network connection), and the serialized data.

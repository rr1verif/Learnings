Timing margin is an electronics term that defines the difference between the actual change in a signal and the latest time 
at which the signal can change in order for an electronic circuit to function correctly.

3 important timing parameters - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#Timing_parameters
Setup time (t su ) - The  minimum amount of time for which data needs to be held steady before the clock event (posedge of the clock),
                     so that the data is reliably sampled by the clock.
Hold time (t h) - The  minimum amount of time for which data needs to be held steady after the clock event (posedge of the clock),
                   so that the data is reliably sampled by the clock.
Clock to Output time (t co) - The time a flip-flop takes to change its output after the clock edge.
